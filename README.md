## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Who Am I?
I'm Colby Fayock! üëã

I help others get the tech out of the way to solve real problems with the tools of the web. I work with the dev community as a Developer Advocate at [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) and am a prolific creator of educational content around the web teaching others through learning by doing one Star Wars plush cuddle at a time.

You might have seen some of my educational work across the web where I help others learn about Javascript, React, and the static web by creating [tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/colbyfayock), writing about those tutorials on [spacejelly.dev](https://spacejelly.dev/), and I'm a course instructor with [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/colby-fayock?af=atzgap) and [Level Up Tutorials](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/ecommerce-on-the-jamstack-with-snipcart-next-js-and-wordpress).

## üß∞ Before the Workshop

You'll want to make sure that you meet the miminum environment requirements in the section below. Basically, you should be able to use npm for working with projects locally on your machine.

We unfortunately won't have time to debug individual setups, so if you're trying to follow along, it's important you can already perform the minimum tasks on your environment.

You also can optionally sign up for a [free Applitools account](https://auth.applitools.com/users/register) ahead of time, but we'll be walking through that during our session.

### Environment Requirements
There's one thing that is probably considered a "strict" requirements for the workshop:
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (npm)

The packages will be included in the repository when using `npm` to install and add the Applitools Eyes SDK.

This means that you should have basic familiar with a terminal as we'll be using it to run commands!

The **operating system** you use shouldn't matter as long as you can run commands with npm (or yarn if that's your thing).

If you can run `npm -v` you should be good to go.

### Setting Up the Project

For our project, we're going to be starting with an existing Cypress test that's included in this repository.

I recommend having the project downloaded and running on your local environment before we start the workshop to ensure there are no issues.

You can either [download the repository as a ZIP](https://github.com/colbyfayock/applitools-cypress-workshop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file or you can use Git to clone it:
- [Download as a Zip](https://github.com/colbyfayock/applitools-cypress-workshop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- `git clone https://github.com/colbyfayock/applitools-cypress-workshop`

## üñ• The Workshop

### Lessons Structure

There are two primary directories in this repository: demo and lessons.

The demo is what it sounds like, it's the project that we'll use to start off and later add our visual tests.

The lessons directory includes a bunch of markdown files which includes instructions for how we'll progress through the workshop. There will be a mix of exercises that we'll work through together!
