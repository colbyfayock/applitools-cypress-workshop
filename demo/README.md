# Applitools Cypress Workshop Demo

This demo comes preconfigured with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and an existing test!

## Getting Started

In your terminal, install the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

Once that's complete, you can open up the Cypress UI with:

```
npm run cy:open
```

Or you can run the tests in headless mode with:

```
npm run cy:run
```

And that's it!
