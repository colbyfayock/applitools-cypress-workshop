# Lesson 0: Introduction

In the world of modern development, there are a ton of moving pieces, and while there are a variety of solutions for making sure those pieces are always working, often there are holes due to the fact we're not testing what people actually see and use.

This is where visual testing comes in, where we can leverage Applitools Eyes to give our tests vision along with broad coverage of our websites and applications.

## Getting Started
Before we dive into our first lesson, we'll walk through the basics and what to expect from this workshop.

## Objectives
* Get welcomed to the workshop
* Understand what you'll learn

## Exercises

### 1. Welcome and where to get started

Thanks for joining along with this workshop! Whether you're new to visual testing or already a pro, we'll help you learn how you can take advantage of Applitools visual testing in existing your Cypress tests to make sure your always delivering high quality.

The homepage of this project has a lot of details about what you need to get started with this workshop. It also gives a little background about who I am and why I'm even qualified to be your instructor!

### 2. What to expect from this workshop

In this workshop, we'll start off by downloading this repository, installing its needed dependencies, and then running some existing tests using Cypress.

We're going to be working with a demo project where we can simulate testing with a live website where we land upon a visual bug that prevents our visitors accommplishing their goal.

Once we're familiar with our project, we'll learn how we can use the [Applitools Eyes Cypress SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@applitools/eyes-cypress) to add visual testing to our existing tests and how we can see and interact with those results in our Applitools dashboard.
